Fundamental elements, including domains, trees, forests, organizational units, and more, define the logical structure, support delegated administration and policy application, and set authoritative methods for directory data and authentication.

Understanding these fundamentals is essential for assessing security posture, identifying misconfigurations, and ensuring that identity and access controls are properly enforced.
