# NoSQL

**NoSQL** databases store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional SQL. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, having fewer relational constraints and consistency checks than SQL.

Like SQL, users interact with data using queries, however, different NoSQL databases use a wide range of query languages instead of a universal standard like SQL, which may be a custom query language or a common language like XML or JSON.

Some common types of NoSQL databases include:

* **Document stores:** Store data in flexible, semi-structured documents, typically using formats such as JSON, BSON, and XML, and are queried in an API or query language
* **Key-value stores:** Store data in a key-value format, where each data field is associated with a unique key string, and they are retrieved based on this unique key
* **Wide-column stores:** Organize related data into flexible column families rather than traditional rows
* **Graph databases:** Use nodes to store data entities, and edges to store relationships between entities
