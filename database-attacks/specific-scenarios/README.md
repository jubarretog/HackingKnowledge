# Attack Techniques

Databases are essential for modern applications, storing vast amounts of sensitive information, including user credentials, financial records, and proprietary data. Attackers target databases to extract, modify, or delete information, often leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and system compromise.

Understanding database attack techniques is essential for both offensive security professionals seeking to test and improve security and defensive teams aiming to protect critical assets. These techniques involve exploiting misconfigurations, weak authentication mechanisms, injection vulnerabilities, and privilege escalation flaws.

In this section, we will explore various database exploitation techniques, including:

* Database injection for both SQL and NoSQL databases&#x20;
* Exploiting misconfigurations to gain higher-level access
* Credential Attacks, cracking or stealing database credentials for unauthorized entry
* Data exfiltration and modification, extracting sensitive records while evading detection
