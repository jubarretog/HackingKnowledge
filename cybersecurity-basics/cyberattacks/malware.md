Malware can take many forms and is typically deployed by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities within systems, applications, or networks. It can spread through various means, such as email attachments, malicious websites, or infected software downloads.

* **Backdoor:** Enables unauthorized access to a system and lets issue remote commands
* **Rootkit:** Give remote administrator-level access to a system and allow modification of system files
* **Ransomware:** Encrypt data or functions of a system and keep it captive until a payment is made
* **Scareware:** Generate pop-ups notifying risk in the system and asking to run a program to fix it, which is malware
* **Virus:** A program that replicates by attaching itself to other executable files. Requires user interaction to activate
* **Trojan:** Act as a decoy of another application to sneak malicious software
* **Worm:** Replicates itself to spread in a network from one computer to another
