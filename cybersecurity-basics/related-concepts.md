* **Ethical Hacker:** A person who acts as an attacker and evaluates the security of an application, system, or computer network to minimize risk
* **Cyberwarfare:** Using technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks to cause damage or disrupt services
* **Hacktivists: A** Kind of threat actor that further their beliefs, using cybercrime as their method of attack. The most common is for political purposes
* **APT:** Advanced Persistent Attack, multi-phase, long-term, stealthy, and advanced operation against a specific target
* **TTPs:** Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Used to describe how threat actors operate to accomplish their objectives:
  * &#x20;**Tactics:** What the attacker is trying to achieve and the form of the attack from the beginning to the end
  * **Techniques:** How the attacker achieves intermediate results during the attack
  * Procedures: The specific implementation and the approaches used to conduct the attack
* **Risk Management:** A Formal process of continuously identifying and assessing risk to reduce the impact of threats and vulnerabilities
* **Pen-Testing:** Involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intentions would use, to find and report system vulnerabilities
* **Offensive Security:** Proactive security strategies that use the same tactics that malicious actors use in real-world attacks to strengthen the security of a system
* **Defensive security:** Protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats
* **Behavior-based security:** A form of threat detection that captures and analyzes the communication between a user on a network. Any changes in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies and may indicate an attack
* **CSIRT:** Computer Security Incident Response Team, specialized in receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer security incident reports
* **Security Playbook:** Collection of repeatable queries or reports that outline a standardized process for incident detection and response
* **Vulnerability:** Defect or malfunction of an application that makes it easy to attack

* **PoC:** Proof of Concept, technique, or tool that demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability
* **CVSS:** Common Vulnerability Scoring System, an open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities
* **VPR:** Vulnerability Priority Rating, a modern framework in vulnerability management that focuses on the risk that could directly affect an organization
* **IPS:** Intrusion Prevention System uses a set of traffic signatures that match and block malicious traffic and attacks
* **IDS:** Intrusion Detection System, detects unauthorized network and system intrusions. It will not take action and won't prevent attacks from happening, just detect, log, and report
* **DLP:** Data Loss Prevention, a system designed to stop sensitive data from being stolen from or escaping a network
* **SIEM:** Security Information and Event Management, the system collects and analyzes security alerts, logs, and other real-time and historical data
* **Defense-In-Depth:** Practice of putting different layers of security controls together in a system to guarantee security
* **SAMM:** Software Assurance Maturity Model, a framework to help organizations evaluate and improve their software security practices. It provides a way to analyze and improve the secure development lifecycle. The most well-known is the [_OWASP_](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/) version
* **PIM:** Privileged Identity Management translates a user's role within an organization into an access role on a system
* **PAM:** Privileged Access Management, management of the privileges a system's access role has
* **Vetting:** A screening process where applicants' backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to an organization
* **Threat modeling:** The Process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols
* **Bug bounty program:** Allows a company to offer a reward for anyone who discovers a security vulnerability in the company’s systems
* **Non-Repudiation:** Ensures that in a communication, neither the sender nor the receiver can deny the authenticity of their signature, message, or action
* **Maliciously formatted package:** Collection of data improperly formatted that an application is unable to identify, causing the crashing or slowing down of the functions
* **Cryptocurrency:** Digital money that can be used to buy goods and services, using strong encryption techniques to secure online transactions
* **Hardening:** The Process of securing a system by reducing its vulnerabilities or security holes, for which it is more prone
* **OSS:** Open Source Software is software with source code that is publicly available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute
* **Default Safe:** A security design principle where a system is configured to be in the safest possible state, unless an explicit action is taken to remove those protections
* **CWE:** Common Weakness Enumeration, a list of software weaknesses to create a common language to describe software security weaknesses that are the root causes of given vulnerabilities
* **PII:** Personally Identifiable Information is any information that can be used to identify an individual, either on its own or when combined with other data
