# Vulnerabilities

## Types of Vulnerabilities

* **Segmentation Flaw:** Vulnerabilitie due to connect different functions of a network all in one, letting the access to all network devices from other unrelationated paths.
* **Repudiation:** When an application or system does not adopt controls to properly track and log users' actions.
* **IDOR:** Insecure Direct Object References, when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. Affects system because the web application does not validate whether the user has permission to access the requested object.
* **Buffer Overflow:** Data is written or changed beyond the limits of a buffer (memory for an aplication) provoking the application to access memory allocated to other processes or crash.
* **Non-Validated Input:** Data that the aplication isn't capable to process is inserted wich could cause crashing or malfunctional.
* **Race  conditions:** The output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs and it don't occur in the correct order or at the proper time.
* **Cryptojacking:** Hiding on a device or server and using it to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's consent or knowledge.
