# Legal Support

Within the field of cybersecurity, the legal aspect is critical for the correct management and mitigation of cyber risks. It encompasses a range of legal frameworks, regulations, and practices designed to protect organizations and individuals from cyber threats while ensuring compliance with applicable laws.

To ensure we remain within the scope of an assessment we can keep in mind some preventive measures:

* Obtain written consent as explicitly as possible from the authorized representative of the assets.
* Respect any limitations specified about access boundaries or tools used.
* Take measures to prevent causing damage to systems or networks being tested.
* Do not access, use, or disclose personal data or any other information obtained during the testing without permission.
* Do not intercept electronic communications without consent.
