# General Concepts

* **Cybersecurity:** Practices that care for individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data.
* **Cyberwarfare:** Use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services.
* **APT:** Advanced Persistent Attack, multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target.
* **Risk Management:** Formal process of continuously identifying and assessing risk in order to reduce the impact of threats and vulnerabilities.
* **Pen-Testing:** Involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent to report vulnerabilities of a system.
* **Offensive Security:** Breaking into a computer system to gain unauthorized acces to it. This will help to report bugs, errors and find vulnerabilities to recommend patches.
* **Defensive security:** Process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats.
* **Behavior-based security:** Form of threat detection tha captures and analyze the communication between a user on a network. Any changes in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies, and may indicate an attack.
* **CSIRT:** Computer Security Incident Response Team, specialized in receiving, reviewing and responding to computer security incident reports.
* **Security Playbook:** Collection of repeatable queries or reports that outline a standardized process for incident detection and response
* **Vulnerability:** Defect or malfunction of an aplication.
* **Exploit:** Program specifically created to attack a vulnerability.
* **PoC:** Proof of Concept, technique or tool that demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability.
* **CVSS:** Common Vulnerabilities Score System
* **VPR:** Vulnerability Priority Rating, modern framework in vulnerability management that focus on risk that could affect directly an organization.
* **IPS:** Intrusion Prevention System, uses a set of traffic signatures that match and block malicious traffic and attacks.
* **IDS:** Intrusion Detection System, detects unauthorized network and system intrusions. It will not take action will not prevent attacks from happening just detect, log and report.
* **DLP:** Data Loss Prevention, system designed to stop sensitive data from being stolen from or escaping a network
* **SIEM:** Security Information and Event Management, system collects and analyzes security alerts, logs and other real-time and historical data
* **ROE:** Rules of Engagement, document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections:
  * _Permissions:_ Give explicit and legal permission for the engagement to be carried out.
  * _Test Scope:_ Annotate specific targets of a network to which the engagement should apply.
  * _Rules:_ Define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement.
* **Defence-In-Depth:** Practice of putting different layers of security control together in a system to guarantee security.
* **PIM:** Privileged Identity Management, translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system.
* **PAM:** Privileged Access Management, management of the privileges a system's access role has.
* **Vetting:** Screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to an organisation.
* **Threat modelling:** Process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols.
* **Bug bounty program:** Allows the company to offer a reward for anyone who discovers a security vulnerability in the company’s systems.
* **Service:** Special type of application that runs in the background
* **Non-Repudiation:** Allows to guarane the participation of both parts of a communication.
* **Malicious formatted package:** Collection of data improperly formatted that an aplication is unable to identify causing crashing or slowing down.
* **Cryptocurrency:** Digital money that can be used to buy goods and services, using strong encryption techniques to secure online transactions
