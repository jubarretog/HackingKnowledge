# Attacks

## <mark style="color:blue;">Attack Stages</mark>

* **Information Gathering:** Collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible.
* **Enumeration:** Discovering applications and services running on the systems.
* **Exploitation:** Leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attempt to expand the access to a system.
* **Post-exploitation:** After getting access we perform pivoting, get additional information that can be gathered, cover the access tracks and report the vulnerabilities.



## <mark style="color:blue;">Classification of attacks</mark>

* **Passive:** Is focused in monitoring and interception of data flows through network traffic.
* **Active:** Data tampering, corruption, extraction or disruption of communication between secured systems.
* **Close-in:** Attacker is in close physical proximity to the objective target. Normally focused in gathering, modification of disruption of access to a system's information.
* **Insider:** Are performed by trusted persons using privileged access to violate rules or intentionally cause a threat.
* **Distribution:** Tampering with hardware or software prior to installation.



## <mark style="color:blue;">Types of Attacks</mark>

* **Spoofing:** A networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address.
* **On-path:** Intercept or modify communications between two devices.
* **Tampering:** Action of  manipulate a system trough making changes to data that you should not, trying to damage and deteriorate it.
* **Brute-Forcing:** Attack based on trying all the possible combinations till finding one who gains access to a system.
* **DOS:** Denial Of Service attack,cause that services can't be obtained from legitim users in a part or the entire network.
* **DDOS:** Distributed Denial Of Service attack, originates from multiple, coordinated sources to generate a massive DOS attack.
* **MItM:** Man In The Middle, the attacker has the capacity of get, insert and modify data in the communication between two machines of a network. Consist in message interception without getting detected by a system.
* **MItMo:** Man In The Middle, can spy on aplication behaviour, SMS or voice calls from a phone and relay them back the data to the hacker.
* **XSS:** Cross-site scripting, consist in the injection of JS-HTML-CSS code or other types of scripts from the Client-side
* **Injection:** Insertion of packages, malicious or unathourised code as part of their input in parts where system shouldn't accept it.
* **Living Off The Land:** Use built-in system tools and utilities with scripts or malicious code inserted, in an attempt to go undetected by system security.
* **Social engineering:** All techniques aimed at talking a target into revealing specific information or performing a specific action for illegitimate reasons.
* **Botnet:** Network of infected computers corrdinated to launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks.
* **SEO Poisoning:** Search Engine Optimization, improving a website for gaining greater visibility. Poisoning push malicious sites higher up the ranks of search results.
* **Sniffing:** Capturing packets sent to the network to identify unencrypted data or patterns that can be used to decipher it.
* **Spraying:** Is based in trying most commonly used passwords and patterns. A dictionary can also be used for this tecn
* **Rainbow:** Compares the hash of a password with those stored in a dictionary precomputed hashes called _rainbow table._
* **KRACK:** Key Reinstallation Attack, manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages tricks a wi-fi WPA2 network into reinstalling an already-in-use key.
