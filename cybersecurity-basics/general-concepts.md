# General Concepts

* **Offensive Security:** Breaking into a computer system to gain unauthorized acces to it. This will help to report bugs, errors and find vulnerabilities to recommend patches.
* **Defensive security:** Process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats.
* **CVEs:** Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
* **IDS:** Intrusion Detection Systems, detects unauthorised network and system intrusions.
* **ROE:** Document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections:
  * _Permissions:_ Give explicit and legal permission for the engagement to be carried out.
  * _Test Scope:_ Annotate specific targets of a networkto which the engagement should apply.
  * _Rules:_ Define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement.Defence in Depth
* **Defence-In-Depth:** Practice of putting different layers of security control together in a system to guarantee security.
* **CIA Triad:** Confidenciality, Integrity and Availability,security model that is used in consideration throughout creating a security policy.
  * **Confidentiality:** Protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse.
  * **Integrity:** Information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made.
  * **Availability:** Data must be available and accessible by the user to be useful.
* **SFU Triangle:** Security, Functionality and Usability, define the level of security implemented in a system.
  * **Security:** Stablish the restrictions in data access.
  * **Functionality:** The features of an application.
  * **Usability:** GUI and user interaction.
* **PIM:** Privileged Identity Management, translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system.
* **PAM:** Privileged Access Management, management of the privileges a system's access role has.
* **Vetting:** Screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to an organisation.
* **Threat modelling:** Process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols.
* **CSIRT:** Computer Security Incident Response Team
* **Bug bounty program:** Allows the company to offer a reward for anyone who discovers a security vulnerability in the companyâ€™s systems.
* **Service:** Special type of application that runs in the background
* **Firewall:** Control what is or isn't allowed to pass through a port.
* **Non-Repudiation:** Allows to guarane the participation of both parts of a communication.
