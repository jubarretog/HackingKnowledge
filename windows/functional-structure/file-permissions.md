_Windows_ uses a security model based on Access Control Lists (ACLs), which specify the users and groups that have specific rights for each file or folder.

Here is an overview of the most commonly used **permissions**:

To see file permission for a file or folder we have to:

* Right-click the file or folder
* Select _Properties_
* Select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view
