# Functional Structure

The _Windows_ operating system is **structured** in a hierarchical format, organizing files and directories, allowing efficient navigation and management of system resources. Here is an overview of the main file system folders:

## <mark style="color:blue;">Common Directories</mark>

The following are common directories in a Windows filesystem that play crucial roles in system configuration, file storage, operational functions, and overall performance:

* _**`C:\`**_**:** The root directory of the system drive, typically where _Windows_ is installed. Contains all files and folders essential for the operating system's operation
* _**`C:\Windows`**_**:** Contains the operating system files necessary for _Windows_ to run. This directory includes system executables, drivers, and configurations
  * _**`C:\Windows\System32`**_**:** Contains system files, libraries, and executable files essential for the core functionalities of the _Windows_ operating system
    * _**`C:\Windows\System32\config`**_**:** Stores the registry files that are essential for the system's configuration and settings
    * _**`C:\Windows\System32\etc\hosts`**_**:** Common file to save hostnames and IPs in _Windows_
  * _**`C:\Windows\Temp`**_**:** Stores temporary files created by the system and applications, which can be cleared to free up disk space
  * _**`C:\Windows\Logs`**_**:** Contains log files generated by the operating system and applications, which can be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring system events
* _**`C:\Program Files`**_**:** The default directory for installing most applications on a 64-bit _Windows_ system. It houses application binaries and files necessary for the software to function properly
  * _**`C:\Program Files\Common Files`**_**:** Shared files used by multiple programs
* _**`C:\Program Files (x86)`**_**:** The default directory for 32-bit applications installed on a 64-bit _Windows_ system, allowing compatibility with legacy software
  * _**`C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files`**_**:** Similar to the 64-bit version, it contains shared files for 32-bit applications
* _**`C:\Users`**_**:** Contains user profiles for all accounts on the computer, where personal settings, files, and application data are stored
  * _**`C:\Users\$username\Documents`**_**:** The default folder for user-generated documents, such as text files, spreadsheets, and presentations
  * _**`C:\Users\$username\Downloads`**_**:** The default location for files downloaded from the internet, making it easy for users to access their downloaded content
  * _**`C:\Users\$username\Desktop`**_**:** Contains files and shortcuts that are visible on the user's desktop, providing quick access to frequently used items
  * _**`C:\Users\$username\AppData`**_**:** A hidden directory that contains application settings, configuration files, and data specific to installed programs, divided into three subfolders: Local, LocalLow, and Roaming
    * _**`C:\Users\$username\AppData\Local`**_**:** Stores data specific to applications installed for the user
    * _**`C:\Users\$username\AppData\Roaming`**_**:** Contains settings and data that can be synced across different devices for the user
* _**`C:\ProgramData`**_**:** A hidden directory that stores application data shared among all users on the system, including configuration files and settings
  * _**`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft`**_**:** Contains various _Microsoft_ application data
* _**`C:\Recycle Bin`**_**:** A special folder where deleted files are temporarily stored, allowing users to restore items before they are permanently removed from the system
* _**`C:\Drivers`**_**:** The folder where _Windows_ drivers are stored, allowing the operating system to communicate with hardware devices like printers, graphics cards, and network adapters
  * _**`C:\Drivers\Backup`**_**:** A subfolder where driver backups may be stored if applicable
* _**`C:\Windows\Logs`**_**:** Contains log files generated by the operating system and applications
  * _**`C:\Windows\Logs\CBS`**_**:** Contains logs related to the Component-Based Servicing
