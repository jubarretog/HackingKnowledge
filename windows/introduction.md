Unlike open-source systems like _Linux_, _Windows_ source code is owned by _Microsoft_ and not freely available for modification.

One of the key features of _Windows_ is its intuitive interface, which allows users to easily navigate through programs, settings, and files, making the desktop environment an iconic part of the computing experience and providing users with quick access to applications and system settings.
