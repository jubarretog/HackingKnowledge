# Introduction

[**Windows**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/) is a widely used operating system developed by Microsoft which has become the dominant platform for personal computers, widely known for its graphical user interface (GUI), ease of use, and broad software compatibility.&#x20;

Unlike open-source systems like Linux, Windows source code is owned by Microsoft and not freely available for modification.

One of the key features of Windows is its intuitive interface, which allows users to easily navigate through programs, settings, and files, making the desktop environment an iconic part of the computing experience, and providing users with quick access to applications and system settings.
