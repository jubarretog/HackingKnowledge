# Pentesting vs Bug Bounty vs Red Teaming

Understanding the differences between Pentesting, Bug Bounty, and Red Teaming is essential for anyone entering offensive security. Although all three involve identifying weaknesses, each discipline has its own objectives, boundaries, methodologies, and real-world implications.&#x20;
