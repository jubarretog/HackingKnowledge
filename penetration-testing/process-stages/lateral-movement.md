# Lateral Movement

**Lateral movement** involves the actions that attempt to expand their access within a compromised environment, exploring deeper layers of a network, moving across systems and networks to discover sensitive assets, and establishing more persistent access.&#x20;

This uses tactics to navigate through interconnected systems and reach high-value targets like databases, file servers, or administrative accounts.

Some components that involve these practices are:

* **Pivoting:** Also known as tunneling, use the exploited host as a proxy and perform actions from outside the network to make sure that non-routable networks can be reached.
* Other previous actions such as evasive testing, information Gathering, vulnerability assessment, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation
