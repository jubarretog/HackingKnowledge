# Enumeration

Involves systematically gathering information about a target's network, systems, and applications, focusing on extracting detailed data such as user accounts, network shares, open ports, and system settings, which can be leveraged to gain further access.

It is also done after completing the exploitation face when gaining access to a shell in the target machine, which is named internal enumeration.

Some of the resources we can check are:

* Available ports
* Active protocols
* Services running
* DNS and subdomains
* Operative System and kernel info
* Credential and Permission
* Normal and hidden files and directories
* Environment variables
* Network interfaces and configuration
* Applications and programming languages installed
