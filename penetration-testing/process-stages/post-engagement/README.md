# Post-engagement

The **post-engagement** phase follows the completion of a penetration test or ethical hacking engagement. During this stage, the focus is on documenting the findings, cleaning up the systems we exploit, and delivering a comprehensive report to the client or organization.

The report typically outlines vulnerabilities discovered, the methods used to exploit them, and the potential risks posed to the system or network.&#x20;

Additionally, post-engagement includes offering lessons learned, remediation strategies, and possibly participating in a debrief or follow-up meeting.
