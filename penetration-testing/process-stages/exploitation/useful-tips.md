# Useful Tips

Here we can find some tips for maximizing the use of exploitation concepts, tools, and utilities:

* Run _calc.exe_ on Windows as a PoC we can run commands.
* On metasploit check the _Rank_ column of an exploit to ensure its reliability.
* Check the kernel version to find any possible exploit.
* Use `sudo -l`  to check sudo execution permissions and environment options.
* Check executables with _SUID_ or _SGID_ permissions.
* Check which binaries have capabilities assigned.
* Check which cronjobs are programmed to be executed.
* Check cronjobs that may be deleted from the system but not from _crontab._
* Check writable folders that can be vulnerable to abuse of _PATH_ environment variable.
* Check NFS configuration files to create a connection with the host machine.
