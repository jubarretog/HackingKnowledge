A **Proof of Concept (POC)** demonstrates the viability of exploitation for a discovered vulnerability, showing the step-by-step process for leveraging it to compromise the system.

It can also be potentially automated to reproduce all the steps that trigger these vulnerabilities, usually in the form of a script or code, or even specific documentation of the process.<br>
