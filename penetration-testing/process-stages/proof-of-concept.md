# Proof-of-Concept

A **Proof of Concept (POC)**, demonstrates the viability of exploitation for a discovered vulnerability, showing the step-by-step for leveraging it to compromise the system.

Can also be potentially automated to reproduce all the steps that trigger these vulnerabilities, usually in the form of a script or code, or even specific documentation of the process.\
