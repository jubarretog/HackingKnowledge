# Useful Tips

Here we can find some tips for maximizing the use of post-exploitation concepts, tools, and utilities:

* Use `hostname` and `whoami` commands
* Use `uname -a`
* Make `cat /proc/version` to get more information about OS
* Make `cat /etc/issue` to know OS information
* Make `ps -A` to show running processes on the current shell (`ps axjf` for tree display mode)
* Use `env` to see environment variables
* Use `id` to obtain information about users and groups, or even info about another user
* Use `ls -la` to check hidden files
* Make `cat /etc/passwd | cur -d ":" -f 1` or `cat /etc/passwd | grep "home"` to know existing users&#x20;
* Check the last used commands with `history`
* Check network interfaces with `ifconfig` to know if could be a pivoting point to another network. Then use `ip route` to confirm an interface cannot be accessed directly by the machine (it won't say it is a default interface).
* Use `netstat` to obtain information about listening ports and services running.
* Search for specific files with `find`
* Use tools such as _linpeas_ or _linenum_ for automatization of the process
