# Post-Exploitation

**Post-exploitation** refers to the phase that occurs after an attacker or ethical hacker has successfully exploited a system. In this stage, the focus shifts from gaining access to maintaining control, gathering sensitive information, and further expanding influence over the target network or system.&#x20;

Activities during post-exploitation often include privilege escalation, lateral movement to other systems, data extraction, persistence mechanisms, and creating backdoors for future access.

We can find some main components in this stage:

* **Evasive Testing:** Improve evasion skills, understanding how and why the client detects behavior
* **Persistence:** Maintaining access to the exploited host
* **Information Gathering:** Comeback to compiling information about the internal resources of a host
* **Pillaging:** Examine the role of the host in the network and the network configurations
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Make a review of internal vulnerabilities of the system and ways of exploitation
* **Privilege Escalation:** Go from a lower permission account to a higher permission one
* **Data Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate information about the target, the users, and any confidential information, and try to transfer it to our machine
