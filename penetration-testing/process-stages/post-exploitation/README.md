# Post-Exploitation

**Post-exploitation** refers to the phase that occurs after an attacker or ethical hacker has successfully exploited a system. In this stage, the focus shifts from gaining access to maintaining control, gathering sensitive information, and further expanding influence over the target network or system.&#x20;

Activities during post-exploitation often include privilege escalation, lateral movement to other systems, data extraction, persistence mechanisms, and creating backdoors for future access.
