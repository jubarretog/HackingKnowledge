# Privilege Escalation

Refers to the process in which an attacker gains rights or privileges in a system, the action of going from a lower permission account to a higher permission one, such as administrative or root-level access.

Privilege escalation can involve:

* Leveraging misconfigurations
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or operating systems
* Abusing access controls and trust relationships

And could provoke:

* Access to Sensitive Data
* Disruption of Services
* Further activities like lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration
* Complete System Compromise
