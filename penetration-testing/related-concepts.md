# Related Concepts

* **Vulnerability:** Defect or malfunction of an application
* **Exploit:** A program specifically created to attack a vulnerability
* **Payload:** The code behind a script that will be executed on the target
* **PoC:** Proof of Concept, technique, or tool that demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability
* **Capabilities:** A way to assign specific privileges to a running process
* **NFS:** Network File Sharing allows sharing of files and folders between networked devices, working under TCP ports 111 and 2049
* **Risk Management:** Identify, evaluate, and mitigate possible risks that could affect the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of a system
* **Vulnerability assessment:** A set of tests and practices that aim to identify a system's possible vulnerabilities. In comparison with Penetration Testing, it is just done with automated tools
* **Pillaging:** The process of collecting sensitive information locally on an already exploited host
* **Post-Remediation Testing**: Reaccess the target to verify that the reported vulnerabilities and vector attacks have been patched properly
* **Banner Grabbing:** Connect to a port hoping to get a response, which could help identify what service is running
* **RCE:** Remote Command Execution, a critical security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system or server without physical access
* **Fingerprinting:** Extract technical details about the technologies used in an application
* **Pivoting:** A technique used to reach other vulnerable systems on a network in which we have already compromised a system, even bypassing firewall rules
* **Relaying:** A technique to access resources present on other systems through an already compromised system on the same network
