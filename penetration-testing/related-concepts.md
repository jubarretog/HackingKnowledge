* **Risk Management:** Identify, evaluate, and mitigate possible risks that could affect the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of a system
* **Vulnerability assessment:** A set of tests and practices that aim to identify a system's possible vulnerabilities. In comparison with Penetration Testing, it is just done with automated tools
* **Pillaging:** The process of collecting sensitive information locally on an already exploited host
* **Post-Remediation Testing**: Reaccess the target to verify that the reported vulnerabilities and vector attacks have been patched properly
* **Banner Grabbing:** Connect to a port hoping to get a response, which could help to identify what service is running
