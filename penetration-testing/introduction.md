# Introduction

**Penetration Testing** is the organized, targeted, and authorized process where we are allowed to perform actions against an IT infrastructure to detect vulnerabilities and security breaches in the system.&#x20;

In contrast to vulnerability or security assessments, which are performed using purely automated tools, penetration tests can be done using any accessible tool, whether manual or automated.

Since the first moment, the scope of the assessment must be defined. This scope could define network boundaries, assets we can interact with, tools and actions forbidden in the assessment, between other legal delimitations.

The most important thing is that we **must stay within this scope** in any action we perform, and also all of this must be documented and written explicitly before proceeding.
