# Welcome!!

Hi! This is a page I've created to compile the knowledge I've gained from my cybersecurity study sessions.

This page compiles all concepts, tools, recommendations, and practices that I consider relevant to annotate, in the form of a guidebook for anyone interested in ethical hacking, offensive security, and cybersecurity in general.

In this guide, I aim to cover operating systems, networks, cryptography, penetration testing concepts, techniques and tools, scripting, privilege escalation, and every other relevant topic for ethical hacking practices.

Furthermore, the final part contains a compilation of my write-ups from machines and CTF challenges I've completed on platforms such as [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), and [PicoCT](https://picoctf.org/).
