# WELCOME!!

Hi!! This is a page I have decided to create as a recopilation of the knowledge I've obtained from my cibersecurity study sessions.&#x20;

This page collect all concepts, tools, recommendations and practices that I consider relevant to annotate, in the form of a guide book for every person interested in hacking and security of information.

In this manner, is expected to cover fields such as Operating Systems, networks, cryptography, concepts and tools related to Pentesting practices, scripting, privilege escalation and every other knowledge which could be relevant in hacking practices.

Furthermore, at the final part can be found a recopilation of my writeups from machines and CTFs challenges that i've completed from [Hack the box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/).
