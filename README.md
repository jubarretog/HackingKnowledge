# Welcome

Hi! This is **Hacking Knowledge**, a page I've created to compile the wisdom I've gained from my offensive cybersecurity study sessions.

This page compiles all concepts, tools, recommendations, and practices that I consider relevant to annotate, in the form of a knowledge base for anyone interested in ethical hacking, offensive security, and cybersecurity in general.

Furthermore, the final part contains a compilation of my write-ups from machines and [CTF](practical-skill-development/capture-the-flag-ctf-competitions.md) challenges I've completed on platforms such as [_Hack The Box_](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [_TryHackMe_](https://tryhackme.com/), and [_picoCTF_](https://picoctf.org/).

I hope this guide offers valuable insights and practical knowledge to anyone interested in the world of cybersecurity for personal growth and professional development.
