# WELCOME!!

Hi!! This is a page I have decided to create as a recopilation of the knowledge I've obtained from my cibersecurity study sessions.&#x20;

This page collect all concepts, tools, recommendations and practices that I consider relevant to annotate, in the form of a guide book for every person interested in hacking and security of information.

In this manner, is expected to cover fields such as Operative System working, networks, cryptography, concepts and tools related to Pentesting practices, and every knowledge which can be used in hacking.
