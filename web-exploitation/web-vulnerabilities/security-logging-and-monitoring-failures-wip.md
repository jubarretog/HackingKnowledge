# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (WIP)

Any miss or lack of reporting, logging, or alerting from activities in a system that should be detected, or are being in some way evaded. This plays a critical role in incident response, forensics, and compliance.

Some common examples could be:

* The firewall system is being evaded
* Lack of reporting after security testing
* The bad maintenance of the integrity of the logs' location
* Lack of Real-Time Monitoring
* Absence of Alerts for Suspicious Activity
