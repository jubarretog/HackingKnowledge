# Web Vulnerabilities

Web vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws within web-based systems that can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an application or its data. These weaknesses may exist in any component that comprises a modern web application, including client-side code, server-side logic, communication protocols, configuration, and even in the underlying frameworks or infrastructure.

They are primarily introduced through mistakes or oversights during the design, development, deployment, or maintenance phases of an application’s lifecycle. Contributing factors can include:

* **Complexity:** Modern web applications are feature-rich and interconnected, making it easy to overlook unintended interactions or pathways that can be misused.
* **Human Error:** Developers may unintentionally write insecure code due to a lack of security expertise or pressure to deliver features quickly
* **Default Configurations:** Vendors often ship software with default settings that prioritize usability and ease of setup, sometimes at the expense of security
* **Software Reuse:** Reliance on third-party components and open-source libraries can introduce pitfalls if their vulnerabilities are not promptly patched or mitigated
* **Constant Evolution:** As technologies and attack techniques rapidly change, previously secure practices may become outdated

The attack surface of a web application is broad, where vulnerabilities can arise at any point where data enters or leaves the system, including:

* **Input Points:** Form fields, query parameters, file uploads, cookies, HTTP headers, and API endpoints
* **Data Storage:** Databases, session stores, and configuration files, especially if not properly isolated or protected
* **Client-Server Interactions:** Flaws can arise in how data is transmitted, processed, or validated across components
