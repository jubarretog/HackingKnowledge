# Useful Tips

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of web exploitation concepts, tools, and utilities:

* Check the URL for user information and queries, as well as the protocol being used
* Make a map of routes to understand the flow of a website
* Check general details and standard files such as the favicon, the _robots.txt_ file, the _sitemap.xml_ file, and the _security.txt_ file, among others
* Check HTTP requests and responses, taking a view of specific details such as headers and their values
* Check page source code, we can use left click or go to the _view-source:$URL_ direction on the browser
  * Check the code commentaries (`<!--`), anchors to other routes (`<a`), framework information, _CSS_ scripts, and _JS_ scripts
  * Check the buttons and the files related to their actions
* Check if URL parameters are displayed directly on the screen. This will tell us that a code injection can be done
* Check if a site displays different types of errors when filling out a form
  * If the username field of a login form shows a different error with specific entries, could mean that is an existing user
* Check if token parameters are sent on the petitions
* Modify in the _HTML_ code the limit of characters for filling out a form. This can be done using the _Inspect_ option of the browser
* Check _the Inspect>Sources_ tab on the browser to see the source files of the site. One of the most common is the _main.js_ file which normally contains the logic for the front-end, and in some cases, how the framework handles some important options like routing and configuration
* When testing a registration form, try to add a `"role": "admin"` field on the POST request to see if we can create a high-privilege account
* Check if is possible to get information about a user or do actions without the _Authorization_ header (normally requested on API endpoints)
* When checking requests with numeric parameters, check how they react to negative inputs
* Add breakpoints on the JavaScript of client-side apps to check the flow of the variables and actions, and even manipulate them
* Modify GET requests to APIs to make  PUT requests instead, by using the `Content-Type` header
* Changing PUT requests to PATCH requests could help to make changes on an app
* When having access to the list of modules from the frameworks of the app, search for any related vulnerability on the versions being used
* Check certificates to look for weak certificates or the use of outdated security protocols
* Check the _allow\_url\_include_ and _allow\_url\_fopen_ parameters in the _ini.php_ files to know if a remote file inclusion could be made via FTP, SMB, or HTTP
