# WebSockets (WIP)

**WebSockets is a modern web technology that enables a persistent, two-way ("full-duplex") communication channel between a client (like your browser) and a server.**

**Unlike normal HTTP requests—where the browser always initiates the connection and waits for a reply—a WebSocket connection allows messages to be sent both from the client to the server and from the server back to the client at any time, over the same connection.**

* With **WebSockets**, after an initial handshake using HTTP, the protocol "upgrades" the connection so both client and server can continuously exchange data in real time.
* This all happens **over a single TCP connection** (the same connection is kept open for as long as needed).

***

#### **What’s the benefit compared to XMLHttpRequest?**

* When you use traditional web methods like `XMLHttpRequest` (as in AJAX), **every message you want to send opens a new connection** (or at least a new request/response cycle). This can add delay and overhead.
* With WebSockets, **the same open connection is reused**, so data can flow rapidly back and forth without repeatedly reconnecting or waiting for each response before sending the next request.

***

#### **Why does this matter?**

* This makes WebSockets ideal for **real-time applications** such as chats, live sports, online games, financial tickers, or collaborative editing, where quick updates from server to client are crucial.

***

#### **Summary**

* **WebSockets:**
  * Full-duplex (two-way) communication
  * Uses a single, long-lived TCP connection
  * Faster and more efficient for real-time interactions
* **XMLHttpRequest (AJAX):**
  * Opens a new request/response cycle each time
  * Less efficient for real-time updates
