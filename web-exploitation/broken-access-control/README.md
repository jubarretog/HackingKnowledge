# Attack Techniques

Web applications are one of the most common attack surfaces, making web exploitation a critical skill in penetration testing and cybersecurity. Attackers often target misconfigurations, weak authentication, and insecure coding practices to gain access, extract sensitive data, or take control of a system.

In this section, we will cover a wide range of web attack techniques, including:

* Injection of malicious scripts
* Hijacking sessions and stealing information
* Forcing users to perform unwanted actions
* Exploiting web servers to access internal resources
* Gaining command execution on a target web server
