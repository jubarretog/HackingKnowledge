# Server-Side Request Forgery

Normally can be seen when an application seems to take internal URLs or network resources that may be able to be modified.

We can find a typical example of this vulnerability as follows:

* A web application allows users to retrieve images by specifying a URL

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
https://$url/fetch?url=http://$url/image.jpg
```
{% endcode %}

***

* If vulnerable we could replace the reference to the image location with an internal URL

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
https://$url/fetch?url=http://localhost/admin
```
{% endcode %}
