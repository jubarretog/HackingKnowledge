This section encompasses the essential concepts, technologies, and protocols that serve as the backbone of modern internet applications and services. A solid grasp of these core elements is crucial for anyone looking to build, analyze, secure, or interact with websites and web-based systems.

In this section, we will explore key technologies such as:

* JavaScript, which powers dynamic and interactive content on the client side
* APIs, which enable data and functionality exchange between different systems
* WebSockets, which provide real-time, bidirectional communication capabilities
* The structure and behavior of HTML and CSS
* Persistent client storage (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage)
* The HTTP/HTTPS protocols
* Browser concepts, such as the Document Object Model (DOM)
