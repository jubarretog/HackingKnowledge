# Fundamentals

Some essential concepts, technologies, and protocols serve as the backbone of modern internet applications and services. The most fundamental pillar of communication is the [HTTP](../../networks/protocols/http/) and [HTTPS](../../networks/protocols/http/https.md) protocols, which are covered in the [networks](broken-reference) section.

Apart from this, a solid grasp of other core elements is crucial for anyone looking to build, analyze, secure, or interact with websites and web-based systems.

In this section, we will explore key technologies such as:

* JavaScript, which powers dynamic and interactive content on the client side
* APIs, which enable data and functionality exchange between different systems
* WebSockets, which provide real-time, bidirectional communication capabilities
* The structure and behavior of HTML and CSS
* Persistent client storage (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage)
* Browser concepts, such as the Document Object Model (DOM)
* Core web security concepts (SOP, CORS, CSP)
* Browser rendering and event handling fundamentals
