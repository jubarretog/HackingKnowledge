# Injection

A type of attack where untrusted data is sent to an interpreter, which can manipulate it to execute unintended actions. Normally, it occurs when we find a way of sending HTML, CSS, JS code, database queries, and others; via a request, a form, website URL, among others.

We can find several ways of carrying out this type of attack:

* [**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**](cross-site-scripting.md) Injects malicious JavaScript code into a web page.
* [**SQL Injection (SQLi):**](../../../database-attacks/sql-injection/) Injects malicious SQL queries into a database, poisoning structured database queries based on SQL with the user input, or even NoSQL database queries.
* [**Command Injection:**](command-injection.md) Executes arbitrary system commands on a server or application.
* &#x20;[Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):](server-side-template-injection.md) Inject template syntax user that is improperly handled or validated to applications that use template engines.
* **LDAP Injection:** Manipulates LDAP queries for unauthorized directory access.
* **XPath Injec**tion: Alters XML Path Language (XPath) queries for unauthorized access to XML data.
* **XML Injection:** Manipulates XML data or queries to inject malicious data.
* **SMTP/Email Injection:** Exploits vulnerabilities in email systems to inject malicious emails.
* **Expression Language (EL) Injection:** Injects malicious input into Expression Language (used in Java-based applications).
* **CRLF Injection:** Injects carriage return and line feed characters into HTTP headers to manipulate responses.
