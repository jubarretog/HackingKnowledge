# Identification and Authentication Failures

Flaw or lack of proper verification of user's identity before granting access to a system or application. Involves issues of managing session controls, weak password policies, missing MFA, and unprotected brute-force attacks, among others.

We can find a typical example of this vulnerability as follows:

* A website manages sessions with a Session ID but is weak and guessable. If we go to the _Inspect>Application>Cookies_ tab, we can check for the session ID.&#x20;

{% code title="Example Output" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="false" %}
```
Name               Value                              HttpOnly
...                ...                                ...
SessionID           3
...                ...                                ...
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In this case, the session ID is assigned sequentially, so we can assume there are previously used IDs and set them to try to access different locations on the page.
{% endhint %}

***

* Sometimes we can find patterns in the generation of the IDs, for example, that the generation is time-based. In this case, we can see that the IDs are generated based on the seconds that have passed.&#x20;

{% code title="Example Output" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
# First generated
Name               Value                              HttpOnly
...                ...                                ...
SessionID         1652592563
...                ...                                ...

# Second  generated 5 seconds after
Name               Value                              HttpOnly
...                ...                                ...
SessionID         1652592568
...                ...                                ...
```
{% endcode %}

***

* A standard for this is often the number of seconds from January 1st of 1970 (Unix Standard). We can check this with a simple calculation as follows:

```javascript
// On the browser console we can use JS to do this process
new Date($ID*1000);
//This will output an approximation to the date of creation of the Session ID
```

***

* Is common also to use ID generated with well-known hashes.

{% code title="Example Output" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
# First generated
Name               Value                              HttpOnly
...                ...                                ...
SessionID     e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5
...                ...                                ...
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We can verify this using tools such as [_hash-identifier_](../../cryptography/tools-and-utilities.md#hash-identifier) and then crack them with services such as [_hashcat_](../../cryptography/tools-and-utilities.md#hashcat) or [_crackstation_](../../cryptography/tools-and-utilities.md#crackstation)_._
