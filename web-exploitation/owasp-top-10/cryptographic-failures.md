# Cryptographic Failures

Any misuse or lack of cryptographic security. The most common examples are weak password hashing, the use of HTTP instead of HTTPS, and vulnerable JavaScript web tokens.

We can find a typical example of this vulnerability as follows:

* Assume we have obtained a password hash. First, we save it in a file

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
echo '$hash' > $file.hash
```
{% endcode %}

***

* Then, we can use _hashcat_ to break this hashed password

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
hashcat -a $attackmode -m $hashtype $hashFile $dictionary
#Example
hashcat -a 0 -m 400 password.hash ~/passwords.txt #400 for PHP, 0 straight
```
{% endcode %}

***

* If successful, this will crack the hash and give us the corresponding password in the form of `$hash:$password`

```bash
#Example output
