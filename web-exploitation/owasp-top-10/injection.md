# Injection

A type of attack where untrusted data is sent to an interpreter, which can manipulate it to execute unintended actions. Normally, it occurs when we find a way of sending HTML, CSS, JS code, database queries, and others, via a request, a form, a website URL, among others.

We can find several ways of carrying out this type of attack:

* [**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**](../broken-access-control/cross-site-scripting.md) Injects malicious JavaScript code into a web page
* [**SQL Injection (SQLi):**](../../database-attacks/specific-scenarios/sql-injection/) Injects malicious SQL queries into a database, poisoning structured database queries based on SQL with the user input, or even NoSQL database queries
* [**Command Injection:**](../broken-access-control/command-injection.md) Executes arbitrary system commands on a server or application
* [**Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**](../broken-access-control/server-side-template-injection.md) Inject template syntax that is improperly handled or validated into applications that use template engines
* **LDAP Injection:** Manipulates LDAP queries for unauthorized directory access
* **XPath Injec**tion: Alters _XML_ Path Language (XPath) queries for unauthorized access to _XML_ data
* [**XXE Injection:**](../broken-access-control/command-injection-1.md) Manipulates _XML_ data or queries to inject malicious data
* **SMTP/Email Injection:** Exploits vulnerabilities in email systems to inject malicious emails
* **Expression Language (EL) Injection:** Injects malicious input into Expression Language (used in Java-based applications)
* **CRLF Injection:** Injects carriage return and line feed characters into HTTP headers to manipulate responses
