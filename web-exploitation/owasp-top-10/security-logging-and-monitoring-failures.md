# Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Any miss or lack of reporting, logging, or alerting from activities in a system which should be detected, or are being in some way evaded. This plays a critical role in incident response, forensics, and compliance.

Some common examples could be:

* The firewall system is being evaded.
* Lack of reporting after security testing.
* Not maintenance of the integrity of logs location.
* Lack of Real-Time Monitoring.
* Absence of Alerts for Suspicious Activity.
