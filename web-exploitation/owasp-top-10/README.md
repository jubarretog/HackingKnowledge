# OWASP Top 10

It is a widely recognized framework that outlines the most critical security risks facing web applications in the present. Developed by the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/) (OWASP), this list serves as a guide for developers, security professionals, and organizations to understand and prioritize their security efforts.&#x20;
