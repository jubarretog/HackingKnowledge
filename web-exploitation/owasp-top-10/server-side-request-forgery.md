# Server-side Request Forgery

When an application allows or is obligated to make requests to the internal network of the server, and can be tricked to make unauthorized requests, allowing the enumeration of internal network services.

Normally can be seen when an application seems to take internal URLs or network resources that may be able to be modified.

We can find a typical example of this vulnerability as follows:

* A web application allows users to retrieve images by specifying a URL.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
https://$url/fetch?url=http://$url/image.jpg
```
{% endcode %}

***

* If vulnerable we could replace the reference to the image location with an internal URL.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
https://$url/fetch?url=http://localhost/admin
```
{% endcode %}
