# Software and Data Integrity Failures

Arise from a lack of integrity in code, software updates, critical data, issues in the supply chain of web applications, or the CI/CD pipelines, or how the development/deployment secrets are managed.&#x20;

Some frequent causes include:

* Use of third-party libraries or software components without verification
* Insecure update mechanisms
* Lack of code integrity checks, like checksums or digital signatures
* Commitment of secrets on open-source repositories
* Avoidance of environment variables handled
* Remain versions or commits with previously in-code secrets
* Deserialization of untrusted data without proper validation or sanitization
