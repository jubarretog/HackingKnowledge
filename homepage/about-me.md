# About Me

Hey!! I'm Juan David, aka JuanDa. I'm studying Systems and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/), and I'm a member of the student group in cybersecurity, [Uqbar](https://www.instagram.com/uqbarun/).

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and ethical hacking practices, with knowledge in software development as well.

My interest in ethical hacking has grown thanks to all the people I've met in the cybersecurity community, and being part of [Uqbar](https://www.instagram.com/uqbarun/) is one of my greatest pride.

My main goal is to prepare for the [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) penetration testing certification and become a professional ethical hacker.
