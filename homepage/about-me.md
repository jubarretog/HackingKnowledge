# About Me

Hi, I'm Juan David, aka _JuanDa_. I'm studying Systems and Computer Engineering at the [_Universidad Nacional de Colombia_](https://unal.edu.co/)_,_ and I'm a member and coordinator of the cybersecurity seedbed [_Uqbar_](https://www.instagram.com/uqbarun/).

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and ethical hacking practices, and an active player in [CTF](../practical-skill-development/capture-the-flag-ctf-competitions.md) competitions. Also, I know about software development as well.

My interest in ethical hacking has grown thanks to all the people I've met in the cybersecurity community, and being part of [_Uqbar_](https://www.instagram.com/uqbarun/) is my greatest pride.

My main goal at this moment is to prepare for a penetration testing certification and become a professional ethical hacker.
