# About Me

Hey!! I'm Juan David, aka JuanDa. I'm studying Systems and Computer Engineering at the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/) and I'm a member of the student working group in cybersecurity, [Uqbar](https://www.instagram.com/uqbarun/).

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and ethical hacking practices, with knowledge in software development as well.

My interest in ethical hacking has grown thanks to all the people I've met in the cybersecurity community, and being part of [Uqbar](https://www.instagram.com/uqbarun/) is one of my greatest prides.

My main goal right now is to prepare for a penetration testing certification and become a certified professional ethical hacker.
