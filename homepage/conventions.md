In a code block, the `$` character is used to denote a value that needs to be replaced depending on each specific case. For example:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
On http://$site/homepage the $site value can be changed with a required URL under a specific scenario
```
{% endcode %}

In some instances, other characters are used if the `$` symbol is part of the statement, but this will be specified in each situation.
