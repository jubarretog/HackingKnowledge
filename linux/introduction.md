# Introduction

[**Linux**](https://www.linux.org/) is a powerful, open-source operating system that serves as the backbone for many of today’s technologies, from web servers and cloud infrastructure to mobile devices and embedded systems. Its flexibility, reliability, and security have made it one of the most popular operating systems, particularly in the areas of servers, networking, and cybersecurity.

At its core, Linux operates on the principles of open-source development, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to modify, distribute, or improve. This openness has fostered a vast and active community, resulting in a wide range of Linux distributions (often referred to as “distros”) that cater to various use cases and users, from beginners to advanced system administrators.
