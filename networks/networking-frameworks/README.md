# Networking Frameworks

Serve as essential **frameworks** that define how data is transmitted and received across networks. These models provide a structured approach by breaking down communication into manageable layers, helping professionals to design, implement, and troubleshoot network communications effectively.

Each layer of a network protocol model has specific functions and responsibilities, ranging from data formatting and addressing to error handling and flow control. This layered architecture allows for interoperability between different hardware and software systems, as each layer can communicate with the layers directly above and below it, facilitating seamless data exchange.
