# Introduction

The **networks** are fundamental infrastructures that interconnect devices, systems, servers, and users, enabling communication and data exchange, which facilitates the sharing of resources and information. Networking involves the transmission of data through various mediums, including wired connections, like Ethernet, and wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi.

Understanding networks is fundamental to cybersecurity, being the foundation for protecting digital assets, as they are often the target of attacks aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in communication protocols, misconfigurations, or user behaviors.

Effective network management involves monitoring traffic, securing communications, and ensuring the integrity of data transmission. Tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and virtual private networks (VPNs) play vital roles in safeguarding networks against unauthorized access and malicious activities.
