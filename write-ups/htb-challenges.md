# HTB Challenges

**HTB Challenges** are short, self-contained exercises designed to test and enhance specific cybersecurity skills without the need to compromise an entire machine,  ideal for sharpening techniques, learning new attack vectors, and practicing specialized areas of cybersecurity.

Their goal is to solve a single problem in a specific knowledge area, and some of them are uploaded from previous HTB [CTF](../practical-skill-development/ctf-competitions.md) events. They are also categorized by difficulty in the same form as the machines, and by their field of knowledge as follows:

* **AI-ML:** Challenges related to attacking or defending AI and machine learning models
* **Blockchain:** Tests knowledge of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts
* **Coding:** Programming skills, solving tasks via implementing algorithms, data structures, and more, with resource efficiency
* **Crypto:** Encoding, decoding, decrypting, or encrypting data, breaking ciphers, or exploiting weaknesses in cryptographic systems or algorithms
* **Forensics:** Investigating and analyzing digital evidence, such as recovering deleted files, examining logs, analyzing disk images, and network packet analysis
* **GamePwn:** Finding and exploiting security flaws in video games or gaming environments, such as vulnerabilities in game servers, network communication, or game files
* **Hardware:** Manipulating or exploiting physical devices, such as IoT devices or embedded systems, to gain access, bypass protections, or extract sensitive data
* **Misc:** This is a catch-all category for challenges that don’t fit into other areas. Can include problem-solving, logic puzzles, and unconventional challenges
* **Mobile Security:** Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in mobile apps (Android/iOS), which can include reverse engineering APKs, bypassing security measures, and extracting sensitive information from mobile devices
* **OSINT:** Focuses on gathering publicly available information to solve challenges. This can include searching social media, public records, or websites for hidden clues and patterns
* **PWN:** Analyzing and exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled binary programs, such as buffer overflows, memory corruption, and use-after-free bugs, to gain unauthorized control of a system
* **Reversing:** Deconstructing software or binaries to understand how they work, often involving disassembling code to find hidden functionalities or bypass protections
* **Web:** Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications
