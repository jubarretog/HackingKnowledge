**HTB Advanced Labs** provides realistic, enterprise-level environments designed for professional penetration testing training. These labs go beyond standard machines and challenges, offering multi-layered attack scenarios that mimic real-world corporate networks and security infrastructures.

They are divided into three major categories:

* **Pro Labs:** Realistic corporate networks designed to simulate real-world organizations with various services, Active Directory implementations, and security defenses, providing end-to-end penetration testing experiences
* **Fortresses:** Permanent community-driven corporate environments where players continuously attack and defend machines in an evolving infrastructure. Unlike Pro Labs, these networks are persistent, meaning they do not reset, and defensive teams patch and update machines over time
* **Battlegrounds:** Fast-paced, competitive cybersecurity challenges where players face off in offensive vs. defensive engagements in real-time and a time-limited environment
* **Cloud Labs:** Focused on the most widely used cloud platforms, each in its own, separate scenarios
