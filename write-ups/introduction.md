# Introduction

As mentioned before, the learning platforms offer a lot of labs and challenges for developing skills and acquiring knowledge. Here are detailed solutions to the challenges and labs I’ve resolved from some of these platforms in the form of explained write-ups.

The write-ups serve as a valuable resource for documenting the steps, tools, and methodologies used to solve them. These can also be considered as an approach when reporting for a real-world assessment.

By sharing these insights, I aim to help others understand different attack vectors, exploitation strategies, and the reasoning for solving complex security challenges.
