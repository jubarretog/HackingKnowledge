# Introduction

As mentioned before, the learning platforms offer a lot of labs and challenges for developing skills and acquiring knowledge. Here are detailed solutions to the challenges and labs Iâ€™ve resolved from some of these platforms in the form of explained write-ups.

The write-ups serve as a valuable resource for documenting the steps, tools, and methodologies used to solve them. These can also be considered as an approach when reporting for a real-world assessment.

By sharing these insights, I aim to help others understand different attack vectors, exploitation strategies, and the reasoning for solving complex security challenges.
