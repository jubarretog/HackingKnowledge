# Introduction

As mentioned before, the learning platforms offer a lot of labs and challenges for developing skills and acquiring knowledge. Here we can find in the form of write-ups detailed explanations and solutions to the challenges and labs Iâ€™ve resolved from some of these platforms.

The write-ups serve as a valuable resource for documenting the steps, tools, and methodologies used to solve them. These also can be considered as an approach when reporting for a real-world assessment.

By sharing these insights, I aim to help others understand different attack vectors, defense strategies, and the thought processes behind solving complex security challenges.
