It involves collecting and preserving data from computers, mobile devices, networks, and storage media in a manner that maintains its integrity for legal proceedings.&#x20;

Digital forensics plays a critical role in incident response, fraud investigations, and legal disputes, helping professionals trace the origins of an attack, understand how a breach occurred, and recover lost or deleted information.
