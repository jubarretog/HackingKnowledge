Active Directory allows administrators to create and manage domains, users, and objects while enforcing security policies and access controls. Its hierarchical structure organizes resources into a logical framework, making it easier to manage permissions and authenticate users.&#x20;

With features like Group Policy management and integrated support for authentication protocols, Active Directory is essential for ensuring secure and efficient operations in enterprise environments.
